1. change range slider colors
2. customize scroll bars
3. add hover darken effect over content-window categories with <i class="fa-solid fa-play"></i>
4. check why squeezing browser window laterally brings horizontal scroll bar (navbar and content-window probably have some width calculation issues)
5. add background gradient (changes shades from orange to blue with time with javascript later)
6. make header and bottom player transparent like realm game hub
7. add arror buttons around .content-window-category-items to allow viewing next items without using horizontal mouse scrolling
