Project Title:
Re&ound | A Music Streaming Platform





Project Abstract:
•	The website Re&ound is a music streaming platform on which users can stream their favourite music.

•	The website has two different pages for its main window, Home and Explore, both of which can be accessed through the Navbar on the left.

•	The Home page is the first page the user lands on upon opening the website and shows the user's recently played music, recommended music and playlists, and some generally popular playlists that the user might like. The Explore page has various playlists based on moods, genres, singers and popularity, and new music for the user to explore.

•	The user can search for music using the Search Bar at the top. There will also be a Profile icon on the top right to update user information and change basic settings like themes.

•	The Music Player lies at the bottom with all the buttons a supple music player has, like Play/Pause, Seek bar, Like, Loop, Shuffle, Queue, Volume, Lyrics, and Player Extend/Shrink, along with a Music Cover Photo.

•	The left side has a quick access Navbar with links to the Home and Explore page, along with a Library section with links to playlists the user has saved and a History page that shows songs the user has recently played.

•	Users can easily Log In and Log Out using the Profile icon in the top right to access their own saved music and playlists.

Details of Modules:

	Module 1:		Basic Looks

	The first module of our project includes building the visual part of the website as represented in the layout mockup. The Home Page, Music Player, Search Bar and Navbar will be implemented here.

	Module 2:		Functional Website

	The website will be made functional in the second module by making the Music Player work with all its features, and allowing the user to navigate through the website and access playlists. Users will also be able to search for their favourite music using the Search Bar.

	Module 3:		User-Specific Features

	Some user-specific features like User Login and making custom playlists will be added in the third module by implementing basic Back-End functionality. This will allow users to have their own user profiles and save their favourite music in playlists to easily access them anytime.

    Future Scope:   Interactive Music Sharing and Streaming Platform

	The website can be made interactive by using a heavy Back-End support. This will allow users to get personalised music recommendations, like and comment on songs, and to upload their own music on the platform for others to listen. We can also add messaging features so users can interact with each other and share their favourite music without hassle.
