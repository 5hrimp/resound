Title:
	<NAME> | An Interactive Music Sharing and Streaming Platform
	(Re$ound, Sonar, Sangeet, Musicana)


Abstract:
	The website <NAME> is a music streaming platform on which users can stream music, share music and interact with other users of the platform.

	The website has two different pages for it's main window, Home and Explore, both of which can be accessed through the Navbar on the left.

	The Home page is the very first page the user lands on upon opening the website and it shows the user's recently played music, recommended music and playlists, and some generally popular playlists that the user might like. The Explore page has various playlists based on moods, genres, singers and popularity, and new music for the user to explore.

	The user will be able to search music using the Search Bar at the top, and upload music using the Upload button besides the Search Bar. There will also be a Messages button to allow the user to send and receive messages and a Profile icon in the top right side and update user information and change basic settings.
	
	The main Music Player lies at the bottom with all the buttons a supple music player has, like Play/Pause, Seek bar, Like, Loop, Shuffle, Queue, Volume, Lyrics and Player Extend/Shrink, along with a Music Cover Photo.

	The left side has a quick access Navbar with links to the Home and Explore page, along with a Library section with links to playlists the user has saved and a History page that shows songs the user has recently played.
	
	Users can securely Log In and Log Out using the Profile icon in the top right to access their music anywhere, anytime and on any device with just access to the internet.
